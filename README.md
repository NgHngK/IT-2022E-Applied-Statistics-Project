# NgHngK-IT2022E-Applied-Statistics-Project

This project is built to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y) based on several attributes, such as job, age, etc. The data is related to direct marketing campaign direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014]. The smallest datasets are provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM). The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).

The dataset used is from the link below:

We perform several methods (logistic regresison, naive bayes, support vectors, decision trees, and random forest) to see the potential of each machine learning models in guessing whether a guess is a potential one that would subscribe to term deposit. 

# Result
This is the comparison chart of all models.
0: not subscribe
1: do subscribe
